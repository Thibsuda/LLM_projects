# What is project for ðŸ’³ ðŸ’³

I havenâ€™t seen a lot of AI and Machine Learning tool on creating a report General Ledger which is is very important foundation of P&L report mostly is manually adjusted by excel or adjust in software .So I've developed and implemented a cutting-edge Language Model (LLM) powered by AI to revolutionize this process. My innovation streamlines the generation of General Ledger (GL) codes for business credit card statements, reducing the time spent on creating expense reports by 80%. Additionally, it introduces real-time analytical capabilities, enhancing efficiency and decision-making.

## Notice

This project involves customizing the Credit Card Statements Report Dataframe for each company based on their bank and report template. It's designed to be run locally on localhost for ease of access and security.
